Which is better in a CPU, more cores or higher speed? Under which circumstances is that true? How many CPU cores does a computer need? 
It depends on what the use is. they pretty much tie into eachother. If you are a gamer then more corse would equal higher speed. only need 6 cores
What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard which fits your processor?
Onboard wifi, bluetooth, multiple RAM, support for graphicscards if necessary
What are the tradeoffs you’d evaluate while selecting a storage device?
Hard disk drive or solid state drive
Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts of a computer, in a way they’d best connect with?
the best way i would put it would be to compare it to a car. For example V6,8,and 12 engines could be like cores for speed and power.
